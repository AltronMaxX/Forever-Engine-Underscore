Forever Engine Underscore attempts to take on the challenge of maintaining Forever Engine Legacy while adding more features to it along the way, making a lot easier for coders to work with it.

Suggestions and contributions for further improving and expanding upon the engine are and will always be appreciated.

* A Full Scripting System, which uses HScript as a basis, [SScript](https://github.com/TheWorldMachinima/SScript);
